/**
 * This class can be used to find the turnpoints in AAT turnpoint areas that
 * result in the largest overall distance.
 *
 * The `TaskPointTracker` class is used to track all valid task starts,
 * all movement inside of the turnpoint areas and the final task finish, once
 * all turnpoint areas have been reached. Inside the turnpoint areas it uses a
 * "convex hull" algorithm to reduce the number of GPS fixes that are potential
 * turnpoints inside the areas.
 *
 * Once the task is first started it will keep track of the best solution until
 * this point in the `_maxDistanceData` property, which is updated inside of
 * the `update()` method. The final and intermediate results are available on
 * the `result` property.
 *
 * The optimal solution is calculated using a directed acyclic graph (DAG).
 * This graph has edges from the center of the start line/cylinder to all
 * potential turnpoints in the first area, from all potential turnpoints in the
 * first area to all in the second area, from all in the second to all in the
 * third and so on. Finally it contains edges from all potential turnpoints of
 * the last turnpoint area to the center of the finish line/cylinder.
 *
 * These edges all contain a `distance` property that tracks the total distance
 * over all previous task legs and the current leg. When we calculate the best
 * solution we iterate over all edges of the last reached area and find the
 * edge with the highest distance including the distance that was flown since
 * the area was reached.
